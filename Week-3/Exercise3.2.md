- Count is 0
- Numbers being immutable values, when we increment count we are assigning to the variable a new instance of a number with the value 1. message is still pointing to the old instance (value, in this case it's the same), so the log is going to print the same old value.It is a pointer to a numeric and immutable value, that sits in memory somewhere. When you do message = count you ensure message and count are pointing to the same memory address, that contains a 0.When you write count++, you are allocating a new number in memory, somewhere, for the number 1, and count now points to the new object. message is unaffected by this operation.
